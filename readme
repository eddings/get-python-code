Code for getting Python repositories from Github and saving to a SQL database (specificially IBM DB2).   

Code generated with ChatGPT.  Not yet tested.

Description by ChatGPT:

"Here's a combined version of the code that retrieves all Python repositories on GitHub, retrieves the code for each repository along with its metadata, and stores each file in the repository separately."

"This code retrieves the list of all Python repositories on GitHub sorted by stars, saves each repository's metadata to a repositories table, retrieves all the Python files in each repository, and saves each file's metadata and contents to a files table. Note that this code assumes that the repositories table has a column called name of type VARCHAR or TEXT to store the name of each repository, a column called url of type VARCHAR or TEXT to store the URL of each repository, and a column called stars of type INTEGER to store the number of stars each repository has. If your table has a different schema, you will need to modify the SQL statements in the ibm_db.prepare functions accordingly. Similarly, this code assumes that the files table has a column called name of type VARCHAR or TEXT to store the name of each file, a column called content of type VARCHAR or TEXT to store the contents of each file, and a column called repository_id of type INTEGER to store the ID of the repository that the file belongs to. If your table has a different schema, you will need to modify the SQL statements in the ibm_db.prepare functions accordingly."
